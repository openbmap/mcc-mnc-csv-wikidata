# Description
SPARQL query to generate a csv of cell providers mcc and mnc

Paste SPARQL query into https://query.wikidata.org/ to get a list of cell providers MCC (mobile country code) and MNC (mobile network code) based on wikidata. Press *Execute* and then *Download as CSV*

#Background
The query searches in wikidata for companies (instance of Q783794) and retrieves property P2259 for MNC and P2258 for MCC

It's all about crowd-sourcing: so far the list is rather incomplete, but you can help by adding your providers MCC and MNC to wikidata!
